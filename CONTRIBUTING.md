# How to Contribute

## Reporting Issues

Should you run into issues with the project, please don't hesitate to let us know by
[filing an issue](https://github.axa.com/Digital/@axa-group/native-proxy-agent/issues/new).

Pull requests containing only failing tests demonstrating the issue are welcomed
and this also helps ensure that your issue won't regress in the future once it's fixed.

## Pull Requests

We accept [pull requests](https://github.axa.com/Digital/@axa-group/native-proxy-agent/pull/new/master)!

Generally we like to see pull requests that

- Maintain the existing code style
- Are focused on a single change (i.e. avoid large refactoring or style adjustments in untouched code if not the primary goal of the pull request)
- Have [good commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Reference issues and pull requests explicitly
- Have tests
- Don't decrease the current code coverage

## Running tests

```command
npm test
```
